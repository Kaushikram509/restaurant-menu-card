This project is a simple **Restaurant Menu Card website** built using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.
**HTML** is used to create the structure of the menu, such as the restaurant name, food categories (like Starters, Main Course, Desserts), and the list of food items with their prices.
**CSS** is used to design and style the menu card. It adds colors, fonts, spacing, borders, and layout to make the menu visually attractive and easy to read.
**JavaScript** is used to add basic interactivity. For example, it can filter menu items by category, show or hide sections, display item details when clicked, or calculate the total bill when items are selected.
